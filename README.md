### [Project Page](https://kagnlp.github.io/xolver.github.io/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14234)

This is a preliminary implementation of the paper "Xolver: Multi-Agent Reasoning with Holistic Experience Learning Just Like an Olympiad Team". More tasks and settings will be released soon. You may see some additional Xolver logs [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O-KYcgQcEniIGfxbUcQjyZLjAzUJkr0s?usp=sharing).

## News
- üì¢ We have added code (unlceaned) for additional numerous agentic benchmarks including 2wiki, Bamboogle, BrowseComp, GAIA, GPQA, Humanities Last Exam (HLE), and SQUAD datasets. We will include the SWE-Bench and OS-World soon. On all of these benchamrks, Xolver achives a new set of SoTA results.

## Running Project

To clone the project, run:

	git clone https://github.com/kagnlp/Xolver && cd Xolver

 To prepare a new conda or python virtual environment, run:
 
	pip install -r requirements.txt
 
The code for running GSM, AIME, MATH and LiveCodeBench tasks may be found in the following subfolders

* ./gsm/ contains code for running GSM
* ./aime/ contains code for running AIME
* ./math/ contains code for running MATH
* ./lcb/ contains code for running LiveCodeBench results

**GSM:**

To prepare GSM with API key, change [here](https://github.com/kagnlp/Xolver/blob/main/gsm/gsm.py#L95)

To prepare GSM with self-retrieval, [here](https://github.com/kagnlp/Xolver/blob/main/gsm/gsm.py#L239) should be empty

To prepare GSM with no retrieval, change [here](https://github.com/kagnlp/Xolver/blob/main/gsm/gsm.py#L309) to "None" followed by the above statement

To generate and evaluated answer for GSM problems through Xolver, run:

	cd ./gsm python gsm.py

 **AIME:**

To prepare AIME with API key, change [here](https://github.com/kagnlp/Xolver/blob/main/aime/aime.py#L95)

To prepare AIME with self-retrieval, [here](https://github.com/kagnlp/Xolver/blob/main/aime/aime.py#L233) should be empty

To prepare AIME with no retrieval, change [here](https://github.com/kagnlp/Xolver/blob/main/aime/aime.py#L303) to "None" followed by the above statement

To generate and evaluated answer for AIME problems through Xolver, run:

	cd ./aime python aime.py

**MATH:**

To prepare MATH with API key, change [here](https://github.com/kagnlp/Xolver/blob/main/math/math.py#L107)

To prepare MATH with self-retrieval, [here](https://github.com/kagnlp/Xolver/blob/main/math/math.py#L245) should be empty

To prepare MATH with no retrieval, change [here](https://github.com/kagnlp/Xolver/blob/main/math/math.py#L315) to "None" followed by the above statement

To generate and evaluated answer for MATH problems through Xolver, run:

	cd ./math python math.py

 **LiveCodeBench:**

To prepare LiveCodeBench with API key, change [here](https://github.com/kagnlp/Xolver/blob/main/lcb/lcb.py#L85)

To prepare LiveCodeBench with self-retrieval, [here](https://github.com/kagnlp/Xolver/blob/main/lcb/lcb.py#L305) should be empty

To prepare LiveCodeBench with no retrieval, change [here](https://github.com/kagnlp/Xolver/blob/main/lcb/lcb.py#L376) to "None" followed by the above statement

To generate and evaluated answer for LiveCodeBench problems through Xolver, run:

	cd ./lcb python lcb.py

 **Without Memory**
 
 To generate and evaluated answer for tasks through Xolver (-) (static retrieval corpus), remove ***EPISODIC MEMORY*** and run similarly:

 	cd ./task python task.py
