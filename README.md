# Xolver: Multi-Agent Reasoning with Holistic Experience Learning Just Like an Olympiad Team

### [Project Page](https://kagnlp.github.io/xolver.github.io/) | [Paper]()

This is a preliminary implementation of the paper "Xolver: Multi-Agent Reasoning with Holistic Experience Learning Just Like an Olympiad Team". More tasks and settings will be released soon. You may see some additional Xolver logs [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O-KYcgQcEniIGfxbUcQjyZLjAzUJkr0s?usp=sharing).

## Running Project

Clone the project, run:

	git clone https://github.com/kagnlp/Xolver && cd Xolver

 Prepare a new conda or python virtual environment, run:
 
	pip install -r requirements.txt

The code for running GSM, AIME, MATH and LiveCodeBench tasks may be found in the following subfolders

* ./gsm/ contains code for running GSM
* ./aime/ contains code for running AIME
* ./math/ contains code for running MATH
* ./lcb/ contains code for running LiveCodeBench results

**GSM:**

To generate and evaluated answer for GSM problems through Xolver, run:

	cd ./gsm python gsm.py

 **AIME:**

To generate and evaluated answer for AIME problems through Xolver, run:

	cd ./aime python aime.py

**MATH:**

To generate and evaluated answer for MATH problems through Xolver, run:

	cd ./math python math.py

 **LiveCodeBench:**

To generate and evaluated answer for LiveCodeBench problems through Xolver, run:

	cd ./lcb python lcb.py

 **Without Memory**
 
 To generate and evaluated answer for tasks through Xolver without memory, remove episodic memory and run similarly:

 	cd ./task python task.py
