## Running Project

To clone the project, run:

	git clone https://github.com/kraritt/Xolver && cd Xolver

The code for running GSM, AIME, MATH and LiveCodeBench tasks may be found in the following subfolders

* ./gsm/ contains code for running GSM
* ./aime/ contains code for running AIME
* ./math/ contains code for running MATH
* ./lcb/ contains code for running LiveCodeBench results

To prepare a new conda or python virtual environment, run:
	`pip install -r requirements.txt`
